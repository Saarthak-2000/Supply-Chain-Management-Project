# Supply-Chain-Management-Project
I've just wrapped up a project delving into "Supply Chain Management in FMCG Sector" where I harnessed the prowess of Machine Learning to optimize the delicate balance between demand and supply.

In this venture, I successfully deployed supervised machine learning algorithms, leveraging predictive analytics to yield positive outcomes in various facets:

Streamlined warehouse supply, resulting in a noteworthy reduction in inventory holding costs.
Enhanced fulfillment of customer demands.
Elevated operational efficiency.
Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, I also delved into demand patterns across different regions, tailoring sales strategies for maximum impact.

Here's a glimpse of the technologies and libraries in my toolkit for this project:

Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Data Manipulation and Analysis: Numpy, Pandas
Statistical Analysis: Statsmodels
Visualizations: Seaborn, Matplotlib, PowerBi
This project not only underscored the potency of data-driven decision-making but also underscored the untapped potential for innovation within supply chain management through the integration of cutting-edge technologies.
